The small cult-like group of students who are involved in the International Baccalaureate program. Laugh at the bags under their eyes and insane amount of homework now, but your sorry ass will be working for one of these guys in the near future. The near future for an IB kid is not so near, though. Having several hours worth of homework doesn't exactly make the time fly. Because of this, they have extensive knowledge about useless topics, for example :Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words. If you are currently an IB student, you would laugh at the irony of such a fact. Then youd quickly realize how this program made you lose your marbles. But you probably never had any if you willingly signed up for IB in the first place.
the international Baccalaureate kids would kill themselves, but they just dont have the time.
